            Design a logo in 4 simple steps
We believe that every business owner should have the ability to create a professional and beautiful logo quickly, easily, and affordably. Designing a logo can be challenging if you don’t have access to the proper tools, which is why our logo maker app does all the heavy lifting for you.

Our step-by-step design guide is here to help you through the creative process of making a unique company logo you will enjoy for years to come. Below is a quick rundown of how to use our logo design software, what you get with your purchase, and how to use and implement your new logo.

Step 1:
Step 1:
Input Company Information
Our powerful AI software will help match you with the perfect company logo by presenting designs that are only relevant to your business -- just enter your industry, company name, and tagline (if applicable). Benefit from a combined 60 text characters, which means you have plenty of room for a creative business name and slogan that will fit perfectly on any logo design and promotional product. Choose an industry category such as art and entertainment, business and consulting, retail, sports, or a dozen other industries. Looking for something particular? Filling out a specific logo type, such as "food" "abstract" or "nature", will display logos with icons related to your keyword.

Step 2:
Choose a Business Logo
marketplace has over 10,000 different icons to choose from. Each one of our designs was created by a professional designer to use for a company brand such as yours. To help narrow things down a bit, select a few logo styles, fonts, and layouts that interest you. Our logo styles range from badge logos to text-only logos -- so it's up to you when it comes to what style you want. We have hundreds of fonts that will help make your logo stand out; choose from unique fonts, modern fonts, traditional fonts and more. Next, select a few logo layouts. Do you want the icon above your company name? What about the icon to the left of the text? You decide! Once you're done fine-tuning the general appearance, our logo maker app will present you with hundreds of different designs.

Edit & Customize Your Logo

By clicking your logo's icon, you can rotate it, change the colors, drag it elsewhere on the screen, and change the size. Don't like the look of your company name? By selecting the business name or slogan area, you can edit the text, font style, font size, and even drag the entire text box to another location within your logo design. Take as much time as you need to make your company logo as unique as your business.

With so many great options to choose from, you may find the toughest part of the whole logo design process is narrowing your choices down. Don’t worry if you can’t choose just one, marketplace lets you create and save as many logos as you want -- only pay for the one you love. After you're done editing your business logo, save it to your account. Our logo maker app will never delete any saved logos, and you can always go back and edit a past saved logo to fit your business needs. Looking to purchase your new logo right away? For just $39.99, you will receive high-resolution files you need to get your business started, including EPS, JPG, PNG and GIF files. These files can be used for both online and offline marketing in order to build visibility for your brand.

Places To Use Your Company Logo
Not sure what to do with your new business logo after purchasing the high-resolution image files? Put it to work!

One of the best ways to promote your brand and your new logo is through online and offline marketing. Here are a few ideas:

Create business cards for you, your employees, and your customers. Pass them out at trade shows, community events, or whenever a customer purchases a product or service. Our business card maker lets you 100% customize the layout and design to suit your needs.
Order promotional products with your engraved logo front and center. Hand out pens at business meetings, or gift custom mugs filled with goodies during the holiday season. Place your logo on car door magnets or banners for all to see. Create custom t-shirts, button downs, and other promotional items for a special event or day-to-day use.
Don’t forget that you have an online audience, too. Build a company website that displays your logo proudly at the top of each page so users can identify your brand online. But first, don’t forget to purchase a domain name that is similar to your company name or industry.
Correspond with coworkers, vendors, customers, and agencies more professionally by opting for a business email address via Google Apps. A great aspect of having a business email is being able to add your company logo to your email signature.
